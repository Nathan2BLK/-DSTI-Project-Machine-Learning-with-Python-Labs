This is a Machine Learning Project.
Our goal is to build a model that will be able to predict a rating for a book, depending on various features.

First import the package of requirements.txt

You can run the notebook to see our results.

The DataSets are improved in place, so the CSVs already have the good shape to run the notebook, it is also an important choice because the additional datasets were too big for being
added on github, so we needed to have them restricted only to the rows that we need.
